# Foodie
Tired of not being able to decide where to eat? Hate being the one blamed when you choose a bad restaurant? Foodie is here to help! 

Foodie works by randomly selecting a menu item from a random restaurant in your area and you decide if you like it or not, if you dont...just swipe left until you find something you'd like to try!


## Features
* Guest mode (Comes with ID that lasts for 30 days to access saved liked food items)
* Single mode
* Couples mode
	* The game will keep playing until both partners "match" on a food item
